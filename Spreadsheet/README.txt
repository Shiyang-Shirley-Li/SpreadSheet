Assignment One - Formula Evaluator   01/11/2020 - 01/17/2020
1. Comments to Evaluators:
	1. I combined the code for both the token is an integer and a variable to avoid reusing code by looking up 
	the variable at the very beginning and changing it into an integer;
	2. I combined the code for "If + or - or / or * is at the top of the operator stack, pop the value stack twice 
	and the operator stack once" case as a helper method to avoid reusing code;

2. Assignment Specific Topics
	1. I estimate that I need 12 hours for this project;
	2. Exactly, I spent 18 hours. I spent about 6 hours making progress toward completion, about 8 hours debugging, 
	about 30 minutes learning tools and techiniques, and about 3 hours to fulfill the requirement for Good Software Practice.
